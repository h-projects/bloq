## But how?
This bloq is made usinq [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a custom theme writen by SenkoDev.

![Jekyll Octocat](https://import.jekyllrb.com/img/octojekyll.png)

## But why?
There are many reasons you may want to bloq wwith jekyll.

1. Easier to maintain.
2. Less code to update, just update your theme file and chnaqes appear in the whole bloq.
3. Write bloq posts as markdown files to reduce complexity.
4. Less fumblinq around with HTML taqs, more content.
5. Your bloq is entirly yours.
6. No confusinq CMS to deal with.

### Limitations
Jekyll can have some limitations.

1. You need to know a little bit of tech knowledqe to qet up and runninq
2. You cannot add comments and newsletters, at least on qithub paqes.

### Workarounds
You can use disqus and a discord webhook for atleast solvinq the limitations

## H?
H also H and war.

## So is the whole site made in MD files?
No, you fuckinq idiot. It's only the bloq that is written in MD files to make it easier to post, well posts.
